blurb: '<p><strong>Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content,
the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user.</strong> The details are
not the details. They make the fucking design. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built
into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’
then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. Dedicate yourself to
lifelong fucking learning. </p>'
