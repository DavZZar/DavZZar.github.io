This was planned a long while ago. After finishing our exams, the class of 2017 (just like any other self-respecting high school graduated class) organised the end of school year trip. Final destination is Novalja, Croatia for one week but before that the class had to get to Zadar to catch a bus to the booked apartments.

#### 7:00

After a half an hour taxi ride I arrived at the airport.

#### 7:30

Check-in is done and so is security. I had a small breakfast in the gate lobby -- Cous cous salad and a salami sandwich. Good shit. People are waiting to board the flight; making their way to pass-control and the gate. It took me a  while to realise that I still had to get over to the gate to board.

#### 8:30

We are boarding the flight.
